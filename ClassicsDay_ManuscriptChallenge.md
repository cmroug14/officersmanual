## ΗΣΦ Manuscript Challenge

### Background

Begun Classics Day 2013, the Manuscript Challenge presents high school students with four Latin manuscripts and asks them to transcribe, translate, and comment on a section of text as it appears in the manuscript.  The challenge is sponsored by the Holy Cross Chapter of Eta Sigma Phi and the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents Club.

Once submissions are received, MID/ΗΣΦ members judge the entries and choose a top three.  Those three groups are then invited to prepare a presentation of their work, to be given on Classics Day.

### Preparations for the Challenge

#### Deadlines

MID and ΗΣΦ members should work to choose four manuscripts for the challenge well in advance of Classics Day.  The competitors are given three weeks to complete the challenge, MID/ΗΣΦ members should take a few days to judge the entries, and the top three finalists are given about a week to prepare their presentations.  Therefore the challenge should be issued to high schools participating in Classics Day approximately one month earlier.

#### Manuscript Selections

Manuscripts should be in Latin and reasonably legible.  Preference should be given to selections that include features students might comment on, such as abbreviations, illustrations, etc.

To avoid giving groups which have participated in the past an unfair advantage, the same manuscript (even if a different passage is selected) should not be reused for at least four years.  So far, manuscripts used in the challenge are as follows:

+ [Cod. Sang. 861](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0861) (2013)
+ [VadSlg Ms. 307](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/vad/0307) (2013)
+ [Cod. Bodmer 124](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cb/0124) (2013)
+ [Cod. Bodmer 52](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cb/0052) (2013)
+ [Cod. Bodmer 44](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cb/0044) (2014)
+ [Cod. Bodmer 47](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cb/0047) (2014)
+ [Ms. lat. 54](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bge/lat0054) (2014)
+ [Cod. Bodmer 88](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cb/0088) (2014)

Latin manuscripts can be found at digital libraries such as [e-codices][ec] or the British Library's [digitized manuscript collection][dmc].  e-codices has a large collection of [Latin manuscripts][ec-l].  Searching for assorted Latin authors and works will find various results on both sites.

Some so-far unused options to start include the following:

- Cicero's *De senectute* (1): Cod. Bodmer 50 [1r](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cb/0050/1r)
- Cicero's *De amicitia* (32, 33): Cod. Bodmer 50 [60v](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cb/0050/60v)
- Cicero's *In Vatinium* (1): Cod. Bodmer 51 [24v](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cb/0051/24v) (starting with "Si tua...")
- Cicero's *De domo sua* (1): Cod. Bodmer 51 [90v](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cb/0051/90v) (starting with "Cum multa...")
- Horaces' *Odes* (II.1): Cod. Sang. 864 [41](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0864/41)

#### Issuing the Challenge

See the .pdf in the repository of the first Manuscript Challenge for a template to modify for future challenges.

#### On Classics Day

The three finalists are to present to the assembled schools on Classics Day.  Presentations (no more than 10 mins) should cover procedures, findings, observations and any questions that were raised or struggled with while completing the challenge.

For Classics Day 2014, the finalists presented at 9:30am, after the welcome by the Classics Day chair and before everyone dispersed for Certamen.  ΗΣΦ/MID judges then determined first, second, and third place for the Manuscript Challenge, and the winners were announced at the awards ceremony later that afternoon.
